# Google Search Console API

Made on Python 3.8.x 

**Install packages first:**

Enter in cmd or terminal these commands:
`pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`

The program makes requests to Google Search Console API and saves the result into a CSV file. 
You can now download as many keywords as Search Console has in 16 months👯‍♂️

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ -> APIs & Services -> Credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID" (!!!Application type = Desktop app!!!) and click "Create".
3. Download JSON and put it in the same folder with the program.
4. Go to APIs & Services -> Library and activate Google Search Console API.
5. Start the program and follow instructions in the console.

I appreciate your bug reports and suggestions🖖
